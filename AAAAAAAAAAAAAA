Subject: Request for Work from Home Due to Medical Reasons

Dear [Managerâ€™s Name],

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to request approval to work from home for the next two months, as advised by my doctor. I have been experiencing heart-related health issues and anxiety, and my doctor has recommended that I have to change my environment and stay at home for better care and recovery.

I have already shared my medical reports and supporting documents with you on your personal WhatsApp for your reference. I assure you that I will remain fully committed to my responsibilities and will be available during working hours to ensure smooth workflow.

Please let me know if you need any further information. 

Thank you for your understanding and support.
